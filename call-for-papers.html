  <h2 style="color: var(--umn-maroon); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Tracks</h2>

  <p>IEEE ICHI 2026 is a premier community forum concerned with the application of computer science, information science, data science, and informatics principles, as well as information technology, and communication science and technology to address problems and support research in healthcare, medicine, life science, public health, and everyday wellness. The conference highlights the most novel technical contributions to stakeholder-centered technology innovation for benefiting human health and the related social and ethical implications.</p>
  <p>We strongly encourage authors to submit their original contributions describing their algorithmic, methodological or empirical contributions, and theories relevant to the broader context of health informatics. Submissions can focus on one or more specific aspects of theory, design, development, evaluation, or deployment. IEEE ICHI 2026 has three main tracks for paper submissions: analytics, human factors, and systems:</p><br>

  <h2>Analytics Track</h2>
  <p>In the Analytics track, we invite submissions on novel methods for exploring and analyzing healthcare data such as biomedical pattern recognition, biomarker discovery, disease profiling and personalized treatment, natural language processing and text mining, recommender systems, clinical phenotyping, visual analytics, explainability, and epidemiological modeling.</p><br>

  <h2>Human Factors Track</h2>
  <p>Contributions in the realm of Human Factors may include empirical studies on the use and needs of health information technology in everyday life, socio-technical studies on the implementation and utilization of health information technology in clinical settings, investigations into the community-level impact and implications of health informatics, design and evaluative efforts centered on innovative user-centered health information technology, as well as empirical research on public policies that leverage health informatics infrastructures.</p><br>

  <h2>Systems Track</h2>
  <p>The Systems track welcomes submissions related to the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of high-performing, privacy-preserving and secure software or hardware systems. In particular, the Systems track invites submissions on the development of large language model (LLM) applications, such as ChatGPT, their utilization in clinical settings, and the strengths and limitations of LLMs in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical research, education, and practice.</p><br>

  <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #e0e0e0;"></p><br>

  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <p>The conference will accept both regular and short papers. Regular papers (10 pages including references) will describe mature ideas, where a substantial amount of implementation, experimentation, or data collection and analysis has been completed.
    Short papers (6 pages including references) will describe innovative ideas, where preliminary implementation and validation work have been conducted.
    The submission site is <a href="">EasyChair</a>.</p><br>
  <p>When submitting papers, the authors must select a track that is most appropriate for their submission. For example, a paper on information systems for healthcare delivery can be submitted to either the Systems track, or the Human Factors track, depending on the focus of the work. Before a submission is sent to the reviewers, the program chairs will also perform an assessment to determine the best fit for the submission.
    Paper submissions must adhere to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates">IEEE Proceedings Format</a>.
    For publication opportunities as posters, demos, or in the industry track, for workshops, tutorials, and the doctoral consortium see the respective other calls.</p><br>

  <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #e0e0e0;"></p><br>

  <h2>Reviewing</h2>
  <p>ICHI uses a single-blind, two-layer peer-reviewing process. The final decision will be made by the program chair of each track based on at least three reviews by program committee members and one metareview by senior program committee members.</p><br>

  <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #e0e0e0;"></p><br>

  <h2>Presentation and Publication</h2>
  <p>All submissions will be published in IEEE Xplore and indexed in other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases. Accepted papers have an oral presentation slot at the conference. Selected papers will be invited to submit the extended version to the Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research, and a fast-track review will be conducted for the extended papers.</p>
