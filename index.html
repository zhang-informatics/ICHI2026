        <strong>Transforming Health in the Era of GenAI and Data Science</strong><br><br>
        Advances in generative artificial intelligence—spanning large language models, image and signal synthesis, and multi‑modal data fusion—are poised to revolutionize every aspect of healthcare, from accelerating drug discovery and automating clinical documentation to powering personalized diagnostics and patient engagement. Early successes demonstrate that Generative AI (GenAI) can draft patient‑friendly educational materials, simulate realistic physiological signals for training, and flag novel biomarkers; however, challenges around model reliability, interpretability, data privacy, and clinical integration must be rigorously addressed. This theme invites submissions that explore innovative applications of GenAI in biomedical research, healthcare delivery, and public health, as well as critical evaluations of algorithmic performance, safeguards against hallucination and bias, frameworks for ethical deployment, and strategies for human‑AI teaming in clinical environments. We especially welcome work that demonstrates real‑world impact, robust validation, and pathways for translating GenAI breakthroughs into safe, equitable, and scalable solutions for diverse patient populations.
